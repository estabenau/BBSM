       This manual describes a numerical hydrodynamic model of
  the equations of motion using a finite
  element method to discretize in horizontal space.
       The major assumptions include the hydrostatic and the
  Boussinesq approximations.
       The model user should be very familiar with
  hydrodynamic modeling and the finite element method in
  general. A useful reference for this information is
  contained in: Wang, J.D., Real-Time Flow in Unstratified
  Shallow Water, J. Waterways and Harbors Div. ASCE, WW1, Feb
  1978. or Wang J. D. and Connor J. J., Mathematical Modeling
  of Near-Shore Circulation. TR200, R. M. Parsons Lab. for
  Hydromechanics and Water Resources, Civil Enginnering,
  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Massachusetts,
  Cambridge 02139, May 1975.
       The user must first determine the domain for which a
  solution is sought. It is useful to consider topography and
  the location of stations from which boundary conditions can
  be obtained in order to delimit the domain. Many of the
  preliminary considerations are discussed in Wang, J.D.,
  Blumberg, A.F., Butler, H.L., and Hamilton, P., Transport
  Prediction in Partially Stratified Tidal Water, J. Hydraulic
  Engineering, 116, 3, March 1990, 380-396.
       Next, this domain is divided into a number of
  subdomains called finite elements. For this model the finite
  elements must be linear triangles. In laying out the grid,
  the user should attempt to keep the triangles as close to
  equilateral as possible. In irregular grids a good rule of
  thumb states that the side length should not change by more
  than 10% from element to element. When laying out the grid
  all available knowledge or intuition about the flow field
  should be utilized fully. Great improvements in results and
  decreased cost of computation can be achieved in this way.
  If this is not done carefully, a computer generated grid
  would serve equally well.
       When an apparently satisfactory grid has been drawn,
  (it is useful to sketch the grid on a piece of transparent
  graph paper which is overlaid the working chart), node
  coordinates and depths should be determined. The coordinate
  system to be used can be any right handed x-y system in
  which the coordinates are measured in the same length units
  (usually feet or meters) as used to specify the acceleration
  of gravity (feet/s2 or meters/s2 respectively).
       The nodal points are given external node numbers, which
  do not necessarily have to be in sequential order. Avoiding
  gaps in the numbering will allow optimal use of computer
  memory, however.
       The computer model will only operate with internal node
  numbers that are determined by the order in which the nodal
  information is read in, see later under description of
  input. This allows for easy alteration of the grid and
  addition or deletion of nodes.
       The elements can now be numbered. The same external -
  internal system is used as for the nodes. For each element a
  connectivity table can then be generated. This table
  consists of the three node numbers for each element. The 3
  nodal numbers must be given so as to define a
  counterclockwize diretion around the element. The first node
  in this numbering is arbitrary.
       The remaining information that the model requires
  consists of physical parameters, integration variables,
  input/output control and boundary conditions. Most of these
  are explained in the input section of this manual. The
  boundary conditions require special attention. If the user
  is not familiar with B.C. for hydrodynamic models the above
  references should be consulted. Basically, the B.C. can
  consist of specifying the deformations (usually flows) or
  forces (usually pressure and sometimes shear stresses),
  since the momentum equations express relationships between
  these variables. Because the model employs the hydrostatic
  approximation, pressure is equivalent to surface elevation
  for homogeneous water.
       The present version of CAFE3D uses a matrix diagonalization
  to allow more efficient solutions and wetting and drying.


  MODEL INSTALLATION

       Before using the model the user should make sure that
  the arrays in the code have been dimensioned properly. This
  involves: 1) Determine the numerical value of key variables
  as described below. 2) Replace the dimensions in the ALL.CMM
  include file with the numeric values of the key variables as
  shown below.

       The key variables are:

           MXNDSL = MAXIMUM NUMBER OF NODES THAT CAN BE
                    HANDLED BY THE PROGRAdM.
           MXQ0BN = MAXIMUM NUMBER OF NODES WITH PRESCRIBED
                    LOCAL X-FLOW = 0.
           MAXQBN = MAXIMUM NUMBER OF NODES WITH PRESCRIBED
                    LOCAL X-FLOW.
           MXV0BN = MAXIMUM NUMBER OF NODES WITH PRESCRIBED
                    LOCAL Y-FLOW = 0.
           MAXVBN = MAXIMUM NUMBER OF NODES WITH PRESCRIBED
                    LOCAL Y-FLOW.
           MAXHBN = MAXIMUM NUMBER OF NODES WITH PRESCRIBED
                    ELEVATION.
           MAXBDR = MAXIMUM NUMBER OF LAND OR OCEAN
                    BOUNDARIES.
           MAXO   = MAXIMUM NUMBER OF NODES IN AN OCEAN
                    BOUNDARY.
           MAXBS  = MAXIMUM NUMBER OF ELEMENT SIDES ALONG ALL
                    BOUNDARIES MULTIPLIED BY 3.
           MAXRAD = MAXIMUM NUMBER OF RADIATION BOUNDARY CONDITION
                    NODES.
           MXFLUX = MAXIMUM NUMBER OF NODES WITH SOURCE/SINK.
           MAXDRY = MAXIMUM NUMBER OF NODES THAT CAN GO DRY AND WET.

  The PARAMETER statement is reproduced here for easy
  reference and as an example:

      PARAMETER(MXBW1=1,MXBW2=2*MXBW1,MXOBN=192,MXOBN2=2*MXOBN,

       There are several named commons, which are used to store
  frequently used variables. These commons are created as
  separate include files. Wherever they should appear in the
  code, an INCLUDE statement appears. Examples of common blocks are
  included as files with extension .cmm.

  The parameter MAXEL should be set to a value greater than
  the number of elements in your problem.

       If your problem has key variables that are numerically
  less than the ones in your version of the main program, you
  need do nothing. If you wish to use as little memory as
  possible, the parameters should be as small as possible for
  your problem.
       Before compiling, you may want to review boundary
  condition subroutines and make any necessary revisions.
  Prescribed surface elevations are handled in STETAB (set eta
  on boundary) and SETMWS (set mean water surface). Prescribed
  flows are handled in STQB. Finally, for wind simulations the
  subroutine WINDS should be customized to return the
  components of surface stress divided by density in TAUWX and
  TAUWY.
       To make a 2-D run do the following: set NLEV and NLEVAD = 1
  (line 2). Set IADVDF=0 and IMULT=9999999 (line group 8).

  !!NOTE!! SINCE MASS STORAGE DEVICES DIFFER FROM MACHINE TO MACHINE
           THE FOLLOWING IS ONLY AN EXAMPLE OF THE TYPE OF INPUT THAT
           COULD CONVENIENTLY BE PROVIDED AT THIS POINT. THIS EXAMPLE
           DIFFERS FROM THE PROGRAM ITSELF WHICH SHOWS YET ANOTHER
           WAY OF HANDLING THIS MATTER. IN OTHER WORDS, THIS INPUT AND
           THE CORRESPONDING CODING IN THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE CUSTOMIZED
           FOR THE USER'S MACHINE AND APPLICATION.

          IUNITQ    = UNIT FOR FLOWS STORED AT KDINCR INTERVALS
          IUNITH    = UNIT FOR depths STORED AT KDINCR INTERVALS.

          IUWTHT    = UNIT FOR writing hot start conditions
          IU3DQ     = Unit for storing 3d results at KDINCR intervals

The direct access files containing hydrodynamic data are written from
FORTRAN using the following statements

      OPEN(IUNITQ,ACCESS='DIRECT',STATUS='UNKNOWN',RECL=NMNP2)
      OPEN(IUNITH,ACCESS='DIRECT',STATUS='UNKNOWN',RECL=NMNP)

      WRITE(IUNITQ,REC=NUMREC)(QX(I),QY(I), I=1,NMNP)(QNLT12(I), I=1,NNLTS)
      WRITE(IUNITH,REC=NUMREC)(HT(I), I=1,NMNP)

QX, QY are the nodal discharges (flow per unit width [m2/sec])
HT     is the nodal total water depth [m]

To get velocities, divide QX and QY by HT
