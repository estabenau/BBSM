Descriptive listing of model structure, input/output file format, associated scripts.

program is in Fortan 

Program starts with:  bbmod.f

bbmod.f calls:
	CF3DMAIN.F
	BBSUBS_CERP.F

CF3DMAIN.F  - main body of the CAFE3D model, a coastal ocean
	circulation and transport model

BBSUBS_CERP.F - this portion is hard coded to include the proper
	input files as follows.

	All times are UTM decimal day starting 0000 Jan. 1 1996 (confirm w/Wang)

Input files start with the following:
fort.1
	Row 1: header for row 2, format:
		print (2=no),elements,nodes,levels,levels_for_advection,initial_friction,initial_depth,
		initial_eddy_viscosity,initial_wind_speed,ihtrd,icnv,kst,kdinc,idns,kdih,nc
	Row 2: data to setup initial conditions for model
	Row 3: initial sigmas
	Row 4: Initialize variable size for elements
	Row 5: description for origin of model grid
	Row 6: description - not read by model
	Row 7: start of element list format: node_id,node_type,x_coordinates,y_coordinates,depth
	Row 6866: start description of connections to make triangles, nodes in clockwise order, format:
			element_id,node_1,node_2,node_3
	5-lines after element list is a data line that sets start time as 0 minutes after
		model origin of 0000 1996-01-01, last time step 504576000. minutes later
		and model time increment for reporting at 20 minutes.

fort.8
	File contains connection information for each node in the model to neighboring nodes
fort.9
	Define diffusion coefficients and hot-start information

/salinity/BB26Salinity.dat		time(UTC) salinity
	BB26 = Biscayne Bay station 26, location near Rickenbacker Causeway bridge
	Data used is (data from this file in PSU)-2.5 ** Wang2008.docx file said," For Rickenbacker
		Causeway, BB26 was lwoer than the derived SV, however there were many gaps so
		SF was used after lowering by 2.5 PSU: RC=SF-2.5

/salinity/BB28Salinity.dat		time(UTC) salinity
	BB28 = Biscayne Bay station 28, location near Bear Cut.  
	Data used is (data from this file in PSU)-1 ** Wang2008.docx file said," For bear cut,
		BB28 was lower than the derived SV, however there were may gaps so SF was used 
		after lowering by 1 PSU: BC=SF-1

/GRIDV3/CANAL_ELEMENTSv3.DAT		structured file
	File breaks down as follows
	#_elements
		#_Nodes_per_element	Element_ID
			Nodes_by_Number

/GRIDV3/GNSWCERPELEM.DAT		structured file
	same format as CANAL_ELEMENTSv3.DAT without Element_ID

/scenarios/CERPGnSW.DAT			time(UTC) 17_columns(all_zero) 5_columns(with_data)
	Sheet flow over surface and ground water flow have been set to zero in this file.
	Remaining 5 columns represent discharge from 5 points.
	These are varied based on model scenario, and the scenario file is saved under this name
	to run the code.
	In the current examples, the last 5 columns are -
		Deering
		Black Point
		Culverts North
		Culverts South
		FPL-CardSound
	I don't know the order
	
/RAINMEVAP.DAT				time(UTC) value(m)
	Value is difference rain-evaporation
	Average daily values for evapotranspiration for period 1965-2000 was determined for
	Homestead and used to create an average year of evap data
	Average year of rain data from 1996-2005 for 10 stations in bay (4kmx4km grid) was
	determined, low variance and programmer chose to use cell 3 (arbitrary) as typical of bay
	Average rain-evapotranspiration was calculated, one sample year is result, year is reused

/CERP_Canal_Flow_96_06.txt		time(UTC) discharge_at_9_structures
	Structure data for each time period is from DBHYDRO at 0.02 day time step
	Structures are, in order:
	G93
	S22
	S123
	S21
	S21A
	S20
	S20F
	S20G
	S197
	Units are m^3/s  (for ref. 1 cfs = 0.0283 m^3/s)

/VKWindUV9606.dat			time(UTC) x_value(m/s) y_value(m/s)
	Data from NOAA NOS Virgina Key station, wind stress for model
	values as x, y components of wind vector (m/s)
