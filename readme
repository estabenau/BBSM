This folder contains the source code and cmm files for the
CAFE3D hydrodynamic model and its application to Biscayne Bay.

The source code is in two files: 
CAFE3DMAIN.F contains the hydrodynamic code (advection & diffusion)
and is currently tested to run in 2D mode but is 3D compatible. 

BBSUBS_CERP.F contains code to read and execute the model for the
Biscayne Bay application. This code is not set up to be completely
parameterized from the input files, some of the necessary
information has been hard-coded into this file

To compile:
Recommended to use f95 (fortran compiler) available with in gcc.
On UNIX systems, the following options worked well:

f95 -O3 -fno-automatic BBMOD_COMPILE.F -o $your_executable_name

Review f95 help files for details.

To run:
Review contents and 'readme' files found within the Input directory
and subdirectories, make sure the paths written into the code are 
correct. At the time of this writing, the various input files that
are read  by the code include the string *_run_file* and contain
data that represents our current understanding of
canal flow, rain, evaporation, wind, and fresh groundwater flow to 
Biscayne Bay.

Simply running the executable that was created in the compile
step is sufficient. It is best practice to create a wrapper that
will call the executable and, when complete, organize the input
and output files.
