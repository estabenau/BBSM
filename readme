This is a revision of the 2015 version.  The model run is from 
1996-01-01 to 2021-12-31.  In this new vesion, the diffusion 
coeficient is changed to as function of depth in 6 zones.  The 
canal and ground and surface flows were based on New RSMGL model
outputs.  Also, some canal inputs elements are changed.

This folder contains the source code and cmm files for the
CAFE3D hydrodynamic model and its application to Biscayne Bay.

THIS IS NOT AN INTERACTIVE MODEL - it is quite old, written in
FORTRAN, operates from the command line, and reads from hard-
coded paths. Not a user friendly model. It will be up to the
user to read through the code, validate input files, and manage
model output.

The source code is in two files: 
CAFE3DMAIN.F contains the hydrodynamic code (advection & diffusion)
and is currently tested to run in 2D mode but is 3D compatible. 

BBSUBS_CERP.F contains code to read and execute the model for the
Biscayne Bay application. This code is not set up to be completely
parameterized from the input files, some of the necessary
information has been hard-coded into this file

These two files are listed within BBMOD_COMPILE.F so you'll 
only need to run the compiler on that in order to compile
the full model.

To compile:
Recommended to use f95 (fortran compiler) available with in gcc.
On UNIX systems, the following options worked well:

f95 -O3 -fno-automatic BBMOD_COMPILE.F -o $your_executable_name

Review f95 help files for details.

To run:
Review contents and 'readme' files found within the Input directory
and subdirectories, make sure the paths written into the code are 
correct for your system. At the time of this writing, the various
input files that are read  by the code include the string *_run_file* 
and contain data that represents our current (2018) understanding of
canal flow, rain, evaporation, wind, and fresh groundwater flow to 
Biscayne Bay.

Simply running the executable that was created in the compile
step is sufficient. It is best practice to create a wrapper that
will call the executable and, when complete, organize the input
and output files.

TO EXTRACT DATA:
A sample Python 3 script is included to show how to extract
useable data from the binary output fort.16 (salinity) file.
