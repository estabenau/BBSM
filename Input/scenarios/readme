Model reads only the CERPGnSW_run_file.dat. Copy scenario of interest to that location before run.

Available scenarios:

CERPGnSW_zero.dat  - a zero ground or surfacewater flow scenario

CERPGnSW_v4.dat - groundwater flow along western boundary of domain set based on
		the surfacwater gradient between structures at ridge and coastal
		water control structures. Details are described in Bull. of Marine
		Science publication by Stabenau, Renshaw, Luo, Kearns, and Wang
