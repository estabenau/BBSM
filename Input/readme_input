The model reads the files ending in *_run_file.dat

The matching file names contain a copy of the data.
Feel free to create new input files and then replace
the contents of the *run_file.dat with your input data.
The model code demands that the files are in a specific 
format so do not change the spacing or use other delimiters.

USE the existing *run_file.dat formats as guides OR
review the model code to set the forma.
