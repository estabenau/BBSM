Only 2 files in the GRIDV3 directory are used:
	GNSWCERPELEM.DAT with a total of 22 defined zones (groups of elements where water enters system)
	CANAL_ELEMENTSv3.DAT with a total of 9 defined zones

Modifications of input locations and widths
	CANAL_ELEMENTSv3_narrow.DAT  modified with the outflow at S21A and S20F narrowed down
	to just 3 elements each.  Part of simple test to see how model responds to changes in
	these parameters prior to trying to set up many seperate small input points - culvert
	but not dispersed across zones.

Modified CANAL_ELEMENTSv3.FPL_RCW.DAT to represent locations of water withdrawals from FPL's
	Radial Collection Well.  Modified position that was previously assigned to the unused 
	S20G (AKA Military Canal). 

Modified GNSWCERPELEMENTS.DAT to include FPL_RCW zone - an area around the point of land
	that will have the FPL radial collector well withdrawals distributed across.  Several
	model runs will be performed using this grid to look at zero withdrawals (base),
	uniform withdrawals across the 3 tiers, or tapered withdrawal with more flow withdrawn
	from tier 1 near the wells and less withdrawn further into the bay

Created *FPL_RCW.DAT to include single 'row' of elements around the proposed Turkey Point
	Radial Collector Well locations. Relased S20G with these values so that we could
	run without modifying model code.

Created *FPL_RCW_ZONE.DAT to include zone of elements around the proposed Turkey Point
	Radial Collector Well locations to simulate groundwater withdrawals dispersed
	from the radial wells over the cone of depression identified by FPL in their
	analysis of the well system.
	Placed the new elements in their own location, leaving in all the previous entries.
	CANAL_ELEMENTSv3.FPL_RCW_ZONE.DAT now has 10 defined zones. 
	Model has been updated to handle the additional zone. Notes in model at
	SUBROUTINE SOURCE and SUBROUTINE STRCFL and at variables ISTR2Q with
	changes near variable FLOWIN in SUBROUTINE SOURCE
