Program reads only the following 4 files:
BB26Salinity.dat
BB28Salinity.dat
CCSalinity.dat
SFSalinity.dat

These represent salinity data at locations BB26 and BB28 and 
Caesars Creek (CR) and Safety Value (SF)

The *.observed values are being stored as the observed values for these stations.
The *.observed values should never be changed - ever. Just being clear about it.

The *_35.dat files are data to be used for static conditions,
that is constant salinity at 35 PSU for these stations.

TO RUN THE MODEL - EITHER accept that the observed values are correct, copy them
		into the appropriate files that the program reads (see note above)
		and run the model...
		OR update the boundary salinity as is appropriate for your scenario
		and then copy those values into the 4 files that the program reads 
		(again, see note above) and then run the model.
